# Word Boggle Project - Technical Implementation ðŸŽ®

## Event System Architecture

In this project, I implemented an event system using ScriptableObjects. This approach is particularly effective because it allows classes to communicate without requiring direct references to each other. A dedicated ScriptableObject handles the events, and classes can simply subscribe to it and execute their respective functions.

The system uses two main event types:
* **VoidEventChannelSO** for simple notifications (e.g., level completion)
* **DataEventChannelSO** for passing data between systems (e.g., word formation events with tile and word data)

## Core Architecture

The basic unit of the system is the LetterTile, with a GridManager that handles the spawning and destruction of LetterTile instances.

The TileSelectionController handles the formation of connections between tiles and makes the word in the UI 

## Endless Mode Flow

The endless mode follows this sequence:

1. **BoggleGame Class**: This class returns a 2D character array. The mastermind behind grid formation in endless mode is this class only, though the algorithm is quite simple.
2. **EndlessLevelController**: This component retrieves the matrix from BoggleGame, initializes the GridManager, and begins grid spawning.

## Scoring System Clarification

I had some confusion regarding the scoring system from the assignment specifications, particularly which characters should receive what point values. To keep things simple, I assigned 1 point to each character.

**Examples:**
* **APPLE = 5 points**
* **PIG = 3 points**

## Level Mode Flow

The level mode operates as follows:

1. **DataLoader**: Level data is parsed by the DataLoader class.
2. **LevelController**: This component retrieves the parsed data (approximately 10 levels) and randomly selects one level for gameplay.
3. **GridManager Integration**: The LevelController instructs the GridManager to spawn the specific grid based on the selected level data.
4. **Tile Properties**: When the GridManager spawns tiles, it also initializes their properties (Normal, Rock, Bug) based on the level data.
5. **TileAbilityManager**: A dedicated class manages tile abilities. When new words are formed, it determines the behavior of special tiles (such as how to destroy rocks or collect bugs).

## Challenge Management System

I implemented a flexible challenge system using the LevelChallenge class that supports three challenge types:
* Make X words
* Reach X score in Y time
* Make X words in Y time

The ChallengeHandler monitors game state and updates progress, providing immediate feedback to players about their current objectives and remaining time.

## What I Would Do Differently With More Time ðŸš€

### 1. Improved Boggle Generation Algorithm

Currently, the 2D character array generation in endless mode for Word Boggle is very basic. I could significantly improve this and implement the bonus tasks that were specified in the assignment.

### 2. Enhanced Tile Property System

The current TileAbilityManager requires enhancement. While it works for this simple project with only 2 tile properties (rock and bug), a system with 10+ properties would require a more robust ability/property type management system.

### 3. Scalable Challenge Management System

The current challenge management system is functional but could be more scalable. I would implement a challenge database system to better manage different challenge types and variations.

## Conclusion âœ…

Due to time constraints, I prioritized:
* **Functional architecture**
* **Working core features**
* **Clean separation of concerns**
